	<p>Documenting my trip around the USA on my very own Segway.</p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      Of eternity. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

	<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way.</p>
	<p>
		I went to a number of places:
		<ul>
			<li>Walla Walla</li>
			<li>Paris</li>
			<li>Lebanon</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
